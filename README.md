# Datatracker on the Norwegian Labour Market

Scripts and datafiles for the data tracker on the Norwegian labour market. 

Web version accessible here: https://qery.no/data-tracker-norwegian-labour-market-jobs/ (English) and https://qery.no/data-tracker-arbeidsmarkedet-jobbskaping/ (Norwegian). 

I have developed this data tracker as a pilot project for the website, experimenting in setting up a workflow for live-updating visualizations gathering data from Statistics Norway, Eurostat and OECD, using Python, Datawrapper and Github Actions. 

The workflow is based on the excellent set-up by Ryan Serpico found here: https://github.com/ryan-serpico/covidTracker, and adapted for use on the data sources noted above.
