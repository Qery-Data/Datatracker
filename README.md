# Datatracker on the Norwegian Labour Market 
Latest release June 2022

Scripts and datafiles for a data tracker on the Norwegian labour market. 

Beta web version accessible here: https://qery.no/data-tracker-norwegian-labour-market/ (English) and https://qery.no/data-tracker-arbeidsmarkedet/ (Norwegian). 

I have developed this data tracker as a pilot project for the website, experimenting in setting up a workflow for live-updating visualizations gathering data from Statistics Norway, Eurostat and OECD. 

The workflow is based on the excellent set-up by Ryan Serpico on how to combine Datawrapper with Python and Github Actions. The repository is found here: https://github.com/ryan-serpico/covidTracker, and adapted for use on the data sources noted above.
